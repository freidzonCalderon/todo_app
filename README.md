The primary objective of this project was to apply the practical knowledge gained during my web development learning journey with React JS. I leveraged the power of React JS and Bootstrap to design the application, making it highly responsive and optimized for use across all devices. Whether you're accessing the application from your laptop, desktop, tablet, or smartphone, you can expect the same level of seamless performance and usability on all of them. This ensures that our application is accessible to everyone, regardless of the device they are using.
